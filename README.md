# Widget_library-cpp
This is my graphical widget library. It was a project at my university to practise c++ inheritance by making this multi file project. It has a widget class and several classes which derived from that. 

You can find a doxygen documentation for the lib here: http://users.itk.ppke.hu/~abrdo/Domi'sWidget_library_documentation/
